# desktop-hasher
A simple Desktop Python App for hashing files
Use cases:
Hashing various files for a digital crime scene.
To find out if a file has been tampered with.

Technical Details:
Used python3 and pyqt5.
This is my first app for desktop development.
The hash used is sha256 as this is considered the golden standard for hashing I believe.
I might work for more features, but I'm not sure yet.
Feel free to open issues and pull requests etc etc
